### [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/squercia/squercia.github.io/blob/main/README.md#profitable-app-profiles-for-the-app-store-and-google-play-markets)

**Description**

Aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. This is an important job as data analysts for companies that build Android and iOS mobile apps, and my job was to enable team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.
It's also strategically important for companies to build apps that are free to download and install, and some businesses dedicate their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that their revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Therefore my goal for this project was to analyze data to help developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

### [Exploring Hackers News Posts](https://github.com/squercia/squercia.github.io/blob/main/README.md#exploring-hackers-news-posts

In this project I've compared two different types of posts from  [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. 

Users submit  `Ask HN`  posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "What is the best online course you've ever taken?" Likewise, users submit  `Show HN`  posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

By managing comparisons I've been able to show:

-   Do  `Ask HN`  or  `Show HN`  receive more comments on average?
-   Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

It should be noted that the data set we're working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by using data cleaninig, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.
**Data** cleaning is therefore an important part of any **machine**  **learning** pipeline.
